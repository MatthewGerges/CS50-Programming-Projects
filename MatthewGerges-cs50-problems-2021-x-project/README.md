# Project Title: Vector Calculator
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4jx3zjKKaw&pp=sAQA
#### Description:
### The vector calculator is a dynamic website created using Flask. It asks the user to input 2 vectors in 2 different form fields.
### The python program accesses the values of these forms as STRINGS via their names on the html page. It then iterates through every character
### of the string: if the character is not a comma or a space, it converts it into a character and then adds it to a new list which represents
### the original vector now with 3 integers instead of a string. 

### The user then selects their desired operation from a drop-down menu. The value of the selected option tells the python program whether to 
### p#erform a dot product or cross product between the 2 vectors. 

### After the form is submitted, if errors are found (for example, the vectors do not have the same number of components), the user is directed
### to an html page that tells them soething went wrong. Otherwise, it directs them to a page that tells them the answer to their question

What are your educational or career goals? 

I aim to become a lifelong learner driven by a curiosity to find innovative solutions to challenges. I hope to surmount these challenges by relentlessly pursuing my passion for mechatronics. I also seek to use my failures as motivation for achievement and as an opportunity to improve my growth mindset. 

I can see myself using my university’s co-op opportunities to tackle global issues such as climate change. These co-op placements will equally cultivate my industry experience and allow me to apply theories I learn from classroom material. I hope to use Waterloo’s advanced technological facilities as a toolbox to leave a lasting impact on the world. I equally aim to become engaged in my university’s extracurricular design teams such as Waterloo’s solar car team. 
During the pursuit of all these goals, I hope to develop my passion for engineering - an interest that has been central in my life from a very young age. As a child, I would draft my inventions on paper and try to build them with the tools around me. Ever since then, I became infatuated with bringing my ideas to life. I began to breed my love for engineering by reading books about programming and learning about designs created by engineers such as Mark Rober and Shane Wighton. 

I further developed this passion by delving into my interest in programming. I became an executive member of Vex Robotics, completed coding courses such as Harvard’s CS50, and created several software projects. I equally used an Arduino to bring my ideas to life by creating autonomous rovers, robotic arms, automated locks, lights, and blinds. Each time I work on these projects, I find myself in a state of flow. The world around me stops and my thoughts become completely immersed within the project at hand. My concerns about the world around me fade and I can feel a deep sense of joy. I hope that by chasing my love for engineering, I can create a unique capstone project and find a fulfilling career that spreads this joy to others while benefiting their well-being.
